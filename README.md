# Muppet

#M - Meaningless (because who cares about the final product?) \n
#U - Underwhelming (when your graphics don't quite hit the mark) \n 
#P - Primitive (because why bother with fancy rendering techniques?) \n
#P - Pitiful (when your graphics are just plain sad) \n
#E - Eh, good enough (because who needs perfection?) \n 
#T - Terrible (when your textures look like they were made in MS Paint) \n
