Muppet is a graphics rendering project that allows you to create meaningless 3D graphics that nobody cares about. With its primitive set of tools and underwhelming features, you can create pitiful scenes that nobody will want to look at.

## Features

- **Meaningless:** Who cares about the final product anyway?
- **Underwhelming:** Never quite hit the mark with your graphics? Muppet has got you covered!
- **Primitive:** Why bother with fancy rendering techniques when you can create primitive, low-quality graphics with ease?
- **Pitiful:** Create graphics that are just plain sad and make everyone wonder why you even bother.
- **Eh, good enough:** Because who needs perfection when "good enough" will do?
- **Terrible:** Create textures that look like they were made in MS Paint and make everyone cringe.

## Getting Started

To get started with Muppet, simply download the project and prepare yourself for disappointment. From there, you can begin creating your own pitiful graphics and exploring the many underwhelming tools and features that Muppet has to offer.

##External Tools Used in Muppet

Because Muppet's graphics rendering capabilities are so meaningless and primitive, we decided to integrate some external tools to make things a bit less terrible. Specifically, we've incorporated Dear ImGui with OpenGL to create underwhelming UIs and pitiful graphics. But hey, at least it's something, right?

So if you're using Muppet and wondering why your graphics are still so terrible, it's because we're relying on external tools to try and make things look halfway decent. Good luck!
