# Muppet

#M - Meaningless (because who cares about the final product?)
#U - Underwhelming (when your graphics don't quite hit the mark)
#P - Primitive (because why bother with fancy rendering techniques?)
#P - Pitiful (when your graphics are just plain sad)
#E - Eh, good enough (because who needs perfection?)
#T - Terrible (when your textures look like they were made in MS Paint)
